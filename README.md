# Html-project-for-it
 Download part2.css, the jpg image and the .html file. Save them to the same directory and see the magic.
I would personally recommend you to create a new folder in the main(:C drive) and save it there. Later on, you name the folder "Html project for it". Then, just open the files from there.
